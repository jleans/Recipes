When you need more bonanza beans try this one out for size...

- 1 lb ground beef (85 % lean 15 % fat)
- Choppy/grindy garlic from Trader Joe's
- 1 Onion (Diced)
- 1 carton of mushrooms (chopped)
- Spices (garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, salt [can do soy sauce instead])

Brown beef, then add onions and cook to translucent. Then add mushrooms. Let simmer with closed lid for 45 ish minutes. Then open the lid until the liquid level has dropped to ur liking. Can thicken the sauce with corn starch or smthing if u wanna be fancy.


With this forbidden recipe you will have food that is actually edible
Make carbs to go with it and maybe broccoli and carrots seperately for vitamins so ur not a little malnourished baby
Potato is good. If you need to reheat make noodles and then after they're drained put them in a pot with the beef and heat on low until good. Can also do this with rice.
